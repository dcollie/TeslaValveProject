"# TeslaValveProject" 
This was a 3rd year project I completed for my BSc Physics for Modern Tech Major at KPU. I designed, fabricated and tested Tesla valves. For the testing phase of the project, I built a circuit with a Trinket M0 and a pressure sensor. I programmed the Trinket in CircuitPython. The code I wrote is in code.py. I have also attached the final project report.
